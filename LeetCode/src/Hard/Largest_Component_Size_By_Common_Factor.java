/*
 * 	This is a Union Find / Disjoint Set problem
 * 
 * 	First of all, the factors of a number can be find in sqrt(N) time, and including the number N itself as factor too. (1 is not counted)
 * 
 * 	Our disjoint set will be formed by a HashMap. Additionally, we have another map which points from the divisor to 
 * 	any of the node which has that divisor as its factor.
 * 		
 * 	{DISJOINT SET}:		(Node)---> 	(ParentNode / RootIndicator)
 * 	{DIVISOR MAP}: 		(Divisor)-> (One of the node which has that divisor)
 * 
 * 	Now, for every factor F of N, it can either be:
 * 		>	There exists a past number M which had the same factor
 * 		>	It's the first time encountering this factor, by N
 * 
 * 	If it exists the past number M that has the same factor, then we had to union the 2 disjoint sets that include
 * 	both numbers together. We will be finding the representator of the factor, and see if the representator 
 * 	of current node N if they are already in the same set or not. If they are the same (In same set), 
 * 	then do nothing (except you may want to have some optimization)
