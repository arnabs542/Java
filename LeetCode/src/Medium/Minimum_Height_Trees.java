/*
 * 	In a tree where every node can be travelled from another root node with only ONE path. (Yes, since there are no cycles,
 * 	a node can be accessed from another node with only one path, NO MULTIPLE PATHS ARE AVAILABLE)
 * 
 * 	We have to think of a root node that we select, that gives us the minimum depth tree available.
 * 	
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	One unexpected thought is: How many such minimum depth tree that it can form, given any number of nodes?
 * 	The answer for that is: Maximum 2.
 * 	
 * 	We can imagine the whole tree as a circle or a area. To choose the root node, we must not choose the edge 
 * 	ones because the distance from one edge node to another end would span over a great distance and thus resulting in
 * 	not the minimum depth tree.
 * 	Therefore, the optimal root node should be to choose the center ones (Centroid). And by proving by contradiction,
 * 	it can be shown that only maximum 2 such root node can exist in a tree.
 * 
 * 	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * 	Suppose we have 3 nodes that result in minimum depth tree. When we trimmed them from the leaf nodes, suppose
 * 	the nodes left are those 3 nodes. Those 3 nodes must now have depth of only 1. However, it is impossible since
 * 	those 3 nodes are to be connected somehow, and without cycles. The only way to form equal depth is by a triangular
 * 	edge, but that would oppose the property of tree. Therefore, the maximum is only 2.
 * 
 * 	As you can see, since every node must be connected. One way to solve this is like topological sorting, eliminating
 * 	those leaves nodes, and check to see if the nodes connected are becoming leaf nodes as well. If they does, then
 * 	remove them in the next turn.
 * 	By shredding off the leaf nodes in each turn, eventually we would reach at the centroid nodes which is the root nodes
 * 	that will form minimum depth tree.
 * 
 *  ============================================================================================
 * 
 * 	Another way is to find out the 2 edge nodes, like 'diameter' of the whole tree. First iteration DFS we will start
 * 	with any node, and get the maximum depth node from it. Then in the second DFS, we will use that last node which is
 * 	one of edges node, and attempt to find the other maximum depth node, which is on the other end, while tracking the
 * 	path used to get there.
 * 	Since now we have the nodes on the two opposite ends, we can find out the middle distance, and obtain the centroid
 * 	for it. If the length is even (like there are 2 nodes in between), then we have to return 2 centroid nodes in our
 * 	answer
 *
