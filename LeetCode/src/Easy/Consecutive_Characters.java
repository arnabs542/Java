/*
*	A Linear scan of string problem.
* 
*	Given a non empty string, the result must always be greater than or equal to 1. 1 is minimum because any character
*	already counts.
*
*	Starting from second character, scan until last character. If the previous character is same as current character,
*	add 1 to power. Otherwise, reset the power.
*
*	After updating the power in each iteration, compare the power to the result, so that result stores the maximum power
*	met.
